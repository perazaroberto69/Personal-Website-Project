    <h1 class="gradient">Video games</h1>
    <p class="p2">There is a handful of video games that i enjoy playing but
         these are just gonna be a couple of the ones that I enjoy.</p>
    <h2 class="gradient" id="hk">Hollow Knight</h2>
    <p class="img3"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/04/Hollow_Knight_first_cover_art.webp/250px-Hollow_Knight_first_cover_art.webp.png" width="300px"></p>
    <p id=p4>I discovered this absolute gem of a game a couple years ago maybe in 2021 and
         i have loved for the four years ive known about it. This games lore is also some
          of the best of so many games ive ever come across its so interesting and it really
           gets you engaged in wanting to the learn the story of the fallen kingdom</p>
    <p class="img5"><img src="https://external-preview.redd.it/DflwHYGUppEN5DUTiFq1sByPpa8AhTLKPZ7rPJIGt9I.png?format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=847140a61df25f3d8963dbb03c6a22689ffe34a0" width="300px"></p>
    <br><p class="p6">The final boss of the game is The Radiance and its one of the best video game bosses that ive played
         really hard but once you get the hang of it its super fun to play i 100% recommend this game.</p>

    <h2 class="gradient">The Metro Series</h2>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/af/Cover_Art_of_Metro_Exodus.png" width="300px">
    <p id="metro">The metro series is a series of 3 open world games that take place in russia after a nuclear war left most of the world a radioactive wasteland that is filled with
         mutant creatures that ypu have to watch out for, the series consists of Metro 2033, Metro Last Light, and Metro Exodus</p>
    <p class="metro2"><img src="https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/metro-exodus-review-6936.jpg?fit=1920%2C1080&p=1" width="500px"></p>
    <p class="metro3">I HIGHLY recommend playing this series as you get to follow the main
        character and see the devlopment of him and his friends through the series, the story is sometimes emotional and really action packed so if your into both of those things you should absolutley check it out.</p>
